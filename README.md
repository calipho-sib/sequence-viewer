# neXtProt sequence viewer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/calipho-sib/sequence-viewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/calipho-sib/sequence-viewer)

> The sequence viewer is a super easy javascript library to use in order to draw a protein sequence in a readable way.

Live demo: https://cdn.rawgit.com/calipho-sib/sequence-viewer/master/examples/index.html

Simple example: https://cdn.rawgit.com/calipho-sib/sequence-viewer/master/examples/simple.html

## Getting Started

1) Include the library using bower or npm or simply by including the javascript sequence-viewer.js
```
//BOWER//
bower install sequence-viewer

//NODE//
npm install sequence-viewer
```

2) Specify a div in your html
```
<div id="sequence-viewer"></div>
```
3) Create an instance of Sequence in javascript and apply the render method
```javascript
//For Node add before : var Sequence = require("sequence-viewer"); //


var seq = new Sequence('MALWMRLLPLLALLALWGPGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN');
// Render the sequence with or without rendering options
// (Check the interactive documentation)
seq.render('#sequence-viewer');

```
4) Et voila!

Note: if you choose the later approach with only the main javascript you should also include the dependencies, jquery and bootstrap.min.css
